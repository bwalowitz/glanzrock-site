            <h2>A man, trying to help his brother stay out of trouble, is drawn into the violent and unforgiving world of the Philadelphia mob in this noir thriller.</h2>
            <p class="project-synopsis">Morris White is the sous-chef at a first-rate Philadelphia restaurant, Le Tour de Cochon. All he wants is to leave behind his past and open his own spot. His dream comes one step closer to reality when the affair he's having with Vicky Ward heats up. Not only is she the manager of the restaurant he's working at, she also comes from money and a privileged background. She wants to make his dream come true, and the only thing that could stop them from doing it together is the one thing Morris hasn't told her about: his half-brother, Vince Kramer, is about to get out of Graterford Prison. Morris is finding it harder and harder to escape his hometown roots, which unlike the crisp, white linens of La Tour, are black as hell and dark as night.</p>
