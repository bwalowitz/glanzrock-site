                <h2>The legend of the logo</h2>
                <p>Inspired by the notion that we’re who we are today because of who we were yesterday, the Glanzrock logo is a symbol representing the infinite power and potential within us all.</p>
                <p>Glanzrock is a family name. Two generations back, Andrew’s grandfather changed it to Gans for show business. The strong center line of the logo represents the Glanzrock line. Each subsequent line and dash are members of the Gans family. The dashes are morse code for their names. </p>
                <p>The circle encompassing these delicate lines is an Ouroboros, an ancient symbol of the eternal unity of all things, the cycle of birth and death from which the alchemist sought release and liberation, wholeness and infinity.</p>

            <h3 class="name">Andrew Davies Gans</h3>
            <h3 class="title">Founder | CEO</h3>    
            <p>Andrew was born in southern California, but for the majority of his childhood he was raised in Las Vegas, Nevada. Before film, Andrew’s dream was to become a major league baseball player. As a high school senior he was drafted to play professionally by the Tampa Bay Rays. Like his father before him, a career ending injury brought the dream of baseball to an end. Built from the same drive, resilience, and vision that led his father, Danny Gans, to be "The Man of Many Voices", Andrew found his way back to Los Angeles pursuing a career in the film industry where he’d begin writing, and producing.</p>
            <p>Andrew started his career when he founded the company, Brackish Dream Entertainment. There he produced films such as, “Get Out If You Can” with Oscar nominee, Ed Harris in a supporting role, and the genre film, “It lives Below”. Andrew also co-wrote the successful comic book franchise, “Solomon’s Men”, published by IDW.</p>
            <p>As a filmmaker Andrew expects to bridge the gap between the indie and studio film, telling intimate stories with strong universal themes on a large scale. In challenging what has been established, the goal is to inspire a new perspective on modern filmmaking.</p>
